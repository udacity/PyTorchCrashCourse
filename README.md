# PyTorchCrashCourse

A few notebooks on deep learning with PyTorch. Instructions from installing PyTorch on your (non-Windows) platform can be found at [http://pytorch.org/](http://pytorch.org/).

### Included files

**Part 1:** PyTorch basics, you'll build a simple feed forward network to classify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).

**Part 2:** You'll learn how to train networks with PyTorch's autograd module. You'll also build a convolutional network which improves performance on image problems.

**Autoencoder exercise:** A notebook that leads you through building an autoencoder with PyTorch, as well as well as exercise solutions.



### More PyTorch

Here's a PyTorch implementation of [a character-level RNN](https://github.com/mcleonard/pytorch-charRNN) that can generate text.
